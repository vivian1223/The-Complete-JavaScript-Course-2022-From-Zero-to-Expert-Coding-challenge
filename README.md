# Introduction 

Basically, this repository is for the coding chanlengings of the course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! If you also bought this course and want to know my solution, you can check my practice index following: 

## Section 2: JavaScript fundamentals part 1
 * branch : feat/section2CodingChallenging#1
    * task: Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
    BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
    * Your tasks:
    1. StoreMark'sandJohn's mass and heightin variables
    2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
    versions)
    3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing in formation about
    whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
    * Test data:
    ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
    ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
