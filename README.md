# Introduction 

Basically, this repository is for the coding chanlengings of the course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert! If you also bought this course and want to know my solution, you can check my practice index following:

    * task: Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
    BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
    * Your tasks:
    1. StoreMark'sandJohn's mass and heightin variables
    2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
    versions)
    3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing in formation about
    whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
    * Test data:
    ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
    ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

   There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculatetheaveragescoreforeachteam,usingthetestdatabelow
2. Comparetheteam'saveragescorestodeterminethewinnerofthecompetition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus1:Includearequirementforaminimumscoreof100.Withthisrule,a
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ๐
4. Bonus2:Minimumscorealsoappliestoadraw!Soadrawonlyhappenswhen both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123 ยง Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
